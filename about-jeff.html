                    <!-- Intro paragraph (usually a “why I like what I do” -->
                    <p>I'm Jeff Johnson president and owner of Seven Hills Financial, LLC. I have found that in my 18+ years in the ﬁnancial services industry that the simpler the approach the better.</p>
                    <p>This simple approach starts with the building of a true understanding of the clients goals, fears and knowledge of the investment and insurance world. With that foundation in place we can then begin to identify the proper ﬁnancial tools that provide the best potential outcome to meet these goals.</p>
                    <p>It does not stop there, this is a long term relationship that requires us to monitor changes and progress, not just the purchase of a product. Being an independent fee based investment advisor and independent insurance agent has provided the best tools I have found to help my clients achieve the best possible outcome in their ﬁnancial goals.</p>
                    <p>The tools utilized can be complex in nature. My job is educate the client on the tools to whatever degree the client wants. Each client is unique in that level of understanding of the tools and their past experience that has lead them to this point. Understanding that aspect provides me with greatest enjoyment in my job. The beauty of this simplistic approach is that it applies equally well to individuals, families and business regardless of their stage of life.</p>
